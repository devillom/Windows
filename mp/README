mp will run a (command line) program in parallel on a group of similar files.
I have tested this with 2 CPU and 16 CPU systems.

cmd-line arguments:

1) the program executable to run in parallel
2) pattern, in double quotes
	a) _input_    the filename plus extension matched by the wildcard file patterns
	b) _base_     the filename without the extension
	c) _ext_      only the file's extension without a leading dot
3) wildcard file pattern #1
4) wildcard file pattern #2
5) wildcard file pattern etc.

Examples
---------
mp.exe "C:\Program Files\ImageMagick\convert.exe" "_input_ _base_.tiff" *.png
This will convert all PNG files to tiff files, which will have the same base name

mp.exe bzip2 "-9 _input_" a*.txt
This will compress all text files starting with "a"

To do
-----
1) error checking
2) have a status for the tray icon, # of jobs completed & remaining
3) save output of each command
