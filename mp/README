mp will run a (command line) program in parallel on a group of similar files.
I have tested this with 2 CPU and 16 CPU systems.

cmd-line arguments:

1) the program executable to run in parallel
2) input pattern, in double quotes
	a) _input_    the filename plus extension matched by the wildcard file in_patterns
	b) _base_     the filename without the extension
	c) _ext_      only the file's extension without a leading dot
3) output pattern, use -- for no output.
3) wildcard file in_pattern #1
4) wildcard file in_pattern #2
5) wildcard file in_pattern etc.
